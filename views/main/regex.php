    <h4 class="text-primary text-center" style="color:darkmagenta;">Quantifiers</h4>
    <p>By default, an expression is automatically quantified by {1,1}, i.e. it should occur exactly once. In the following list, E stands for expression. An expression is a character, or an abbreviation for a set of characters, or a set of characters in square brackets, or an expression in parentheses.</p>

            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>E?</td>
            <td>Matches zero or one occurrences of E. This quantifier means The previous expression is optional, because it will match whether or not the expression is found. E? is the same as E{0,1}. e.g., dents? matches 'dent' or 'dents'.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E+</td>
            <td>Matches one or more occurrences of E. E+ is the same as E{1,}. e.g., 0+ matches '0', '00', '000', etc.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E*</td>
            <td>Matches zero or more occurrences of E. It is the same as E{0,}. The * quantifier is often used in error where + should be used. For example, if \s*$ is used in an expression to match strings that end in whitespace, it will match every string because \s*$ means Match zero or more whitespaces followed by end of string. The correct regexp to match strings that have at least one trailing whitespace character is \s+$.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E{n}</td>
            <td>Matches exactly n occurrences of E. E{n} is the same as repeating E n times. For example, x{5} is the same as xxxxx. It is also the same as E{n,n}, e.g. x{5,5}.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    <h4 class="text-primary text-center" style="color:#fd7e14;">Assertions</h4>
    <p>Assertions make some statement about the text at the point where they occur in the regexp but they do not match any characters. In the following list E stands for any expression.</p>

        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>^</td>
            <td>The caret signifies the beginning of the string. If you wish to match a literal ^ you must escape it by writing \\^. For example, ^#include will only match strings which begin with the characters '#include'. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$</td>
            <td>The dollar signifies the end of the string. For example \d\s*$ will match strings which end with a digit optionally followed by whitespace. If you wish to match a literal $ you must escape it by writing \\$.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\b</td>
            <td>A word boundary. For example the regexp \bOK\b means match immediately after a word boundary (e.g. start of string or whitespace) the letter 'O' then the letter 'K' immediately before another word boundary (e.g. end of string or whitespace). But note that the assertion does not actually match any whitespace so if we write (\bOK\b) and we have a match it will only contain 'OK' even if the string is "It's OK now".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\B</td>
            <td>A non-word boundary. This assertion is true wherever \b is false. For example if we searched for \Bon\B in "Left on" the match would fail (space and end of string aren't non-word boundaries), but it would match in "tonne".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>(?=E)</td>
            <td>Positive lookahead. This assertion is true if the expression matches at this point in the regexp. For example, const(?=\s+char) matches 'const' whenever it is followed by 'char', as in 'static const char *'. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>(?!E)</td>
            <td>Negative lookahead. This assertion is true if the expression does not match at this point in the regexp. For example, const(?!\s+char) matches 'const' except when it is followed by 'char'.</td>
